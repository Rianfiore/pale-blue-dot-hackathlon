Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator of the greenness of the biomes.

Even though it is not a physical property of the vegetation cover, its very simple formulation
NDVI = (REF_nir â€“ REF_red)/(REF_nir + REF_red)
where REF_nir and REF_red are the spectral reflectances measured in the near infrared and red wavebands respectively, makes it widely used for ecosystems monitoring.
