Copernicus Soil Water Index
The Soil Water Index quantifies the moisture condition at various depths in the soil. 
It is mainly driven by the precipitation via the process of infiltration. Soil moisture is a very heterogeneous 
variable and varies on small scales with soil properties and drainage patterns. 
Satellite measurements integrate over relative large-scale areas, with the presence of vegetation adding complexity 
to the interpretation.

The soil moisture, up to 5cm soil depth, is recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the 
Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).
